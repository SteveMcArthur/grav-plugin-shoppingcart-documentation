#  Adding the cart to external pages (not managed by the shopping cart)
Simply include the `partials/shoppingcart_core_cart_external.html.twig` Twig in page twigs you want.

<pre><code>{% include 'partials/shoppingcart_core_cart_external.html.twig' %}</code></pre>

and then enable the "Load Cart JavaScript globally" option in Admin (if you prefer, `general.load_js_globally` in `shoppingcart.yaml`.

You can add the above Twig snippet even in `base.html.twig`, the plugin will make sure the cart is not inserted 2 times in pages that already include it.
